Obtaining api_id

In order to obtain an API id and develop your own application using the Telegram API you need to do the following:

    Sign up for Telegram using any application.
    Log in to your Telegram core: https://my.telegram.org.
    Go to "API development tools" and fill out the form.
    You will get basic addresses as well as the api_id and api_hash parameters required for user authorization.
    For the moment each number can only have one api_id connected to it.

    Copy the credintials in Config.ini
    keep it secure or else your account may be compromised 

please use an up-to-date number connected to your active Telegram account.

 Important :  Disable 2-Factor Auth on telegram account
